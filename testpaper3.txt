Stakeholders advocating the use of public funds to finance
the hosting of major sporting events frequently argue that
these investments pay off in terms of increased economic
activity (Storm, Thomsen, & Jakobsen, 2017). Politicians,
decision-makers and even public authorities often claim
that such events are considered a benefit due to the tangible
effects they bring (Jakobsen, Solberg, Halvorsen, & Jakobsen, 2013). Usually the argument is that the events are
worth the cost because they boost tourism and create a
branding effect that showcases the host nation or city
(Zimbalist, 2017). However, research suggests that this is
seldom the case.
Preuss (2015) argues that (economic) legacies stemming from major sporting events must be considered as
no more than ‘potential’. At the outset, there may be potentially tangible (economic) benefits forecast that exceed the
costs associated with hosting the sporting events, but
there is no guarantee that these will materialize in reality
(Larissa, 2017). Studies on the Olympic Games (e.g.,
Baade & Matheson, 2016), the FIFA World Cup (e.g.,
Baade & Matheson, 2004; Zimbalist, 2015), major league
sport franchises in the United States (e.g., Baade, 1994;
Baade & Matheson, 2001; Richardson, 2002), college
sports (in the United States) (e.g., Baade, Baumann, &
Matheson, 2011), and motor sports (e.g., Baade & Matheson, 2000; Coates & Gearhart, 2008) (also in the United
States) show that positive impacts are rare, and can in some
cases even be negative as the costs associated with hosting
the events crowd out more efficient use of the funds
(Coates & Humphreys, 2003a, 2003b, 2008). In this
paper, we examine how a particular major event, a Formula
1 (F1) grand prix, affects local economies.
F1 is an interesting case because of its commercial
appeal (Mourâo, 2017) and large international consumer
interest. The concept of a grand prix race dates back to
1894, with F1 adopting its current format as a world
championship series in 1950 with races being run in
seven different countries: Britain, Monaco, the United
States, Switzerland, France, Belgium and Italy (Jenkins,
Pasternak, & West, 2016). Since then, the series has spread
to more continents and it now (2019) has hosts in 21
countries.
F1 broadcasts reach millions of viewers around the
globe. The 2011 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne
alone had 120,000 unique spectators, while 20 million
people followed it on television in European Union
countries, according to Ernst and Young (2011). In 2016,
F1 was acquired by Liberty Media for US$8 billion (Liberty Media Corporation, 2016) and had a total turnover
of US$1.8 billion in 2017, according to the British newspaper The Independent. Figures estimated by Jenkins et al.
(2016) show that the overall global viewership is around
425 million people and ‘is only surpassed by the Olympic
Games and the World Cup football tournament, both of
which are held only every four years’ (p. 11). Its worldwide
viewership and high turnover suggest that the F1 races
could draw enough attention to boost tourism or create
other forms of increased economic activity in the host
regions or cities, and hence create positive effects (Remenyik & Molnár, 2017).
In general, when F1 races and circuits are established
the economic benefits are reported to be significant. A
clear example of this is the Circuit of Americanas in Austin,
Texas, where the economic impact of F1 races alone added
up to US$2.8 billion – equivalent to 25,000 jobs – from
2012 to 2015, according to calculations published on the
circuit’s webpage. Figures such as these, indicating great
economic stimulus, have often prompted public authorities
to subsidize F1. As pointed out by the international financial magazine Forbes, all current F1 races except the British
Grand Prix receive substantial public funding (Jenkins
et al., 2016; Mourâo, 2017).
For example, the establishment of the Yas Marina F1
circuit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), in
2009 was part of a deliberate effort to turn the city into a
global sport and major events destination (Oxford Business
Group, 2016). In order to develop its hospitality industry
and attract foreign visitors, the Abu Dhabi government
provided the US$1.3 billion in construction costs for the
circuit as well as spending another US$1 billion on new
venues and other renovation projects in the city.
Compared with other major sporting events, F1 races
are held every year in the respective host nations. This
makes it easier to use infrastructural investments connected
to hosting F1 races compared with – for example – the
Olympics or the football World Cup, which are becoming
increasingly renowned for demanding new stadiums that
turn into white elephants after the events are held (Alm,
Solberg, Storm, & Jakobsen, 2014). As infrastructural
costs connected to F1 races are relatively small and circuits
often can be reused, economic net effects on the host city or
nation are more likely to materialize.
However, judging whether ‘investments’ of public
money in F1 races are appropriate depends on whether
the economic activity associated with the events is significant enough to justify them (Baade & Matheson, 2000).
To the best of our knowledge, no previous academic studies
have investigated this issue. Studies of F1 that do exist are
mainly produced by hired consultancy firms that apply
input–output (IO) or computable general equilibrium
(CGE) methodologies, which have been increasingly criticized for being too simplistic (Dwyer, Forsyth, & Spurr,
2005). In doing so, they apply inflated multipliers, overestimate benefits and leave out the (opportunity) costs of
hosting an event (Taks, Késenne, Chalip, Green, &
Martyn, 2011). This is a problem because politicians and
public authorities are left with misleading evidence that
could lead to the wrong decisions being made regarding
financial support for F1 races and/or circuits. To address
this, we apply robust regression modelling techniques on
available objective data to test the effects of hosting an
F1 race.
The paper is structured as follows. It next reviews the
existing literature on the effects of major sporting events
and F1. It then examines the methodologies used in existing studies that prompted the authors to apply the
regression techniques used in the present paper. The
paper then presents the data together with a brief overview
of the methodological issues connected to the regression
estimation strategy. The results are next presented and discussed, followed by a conclusion focusing on the implications and limitations of the findings and prospects for
future research on the subject.
The legacies and impact of sporting events of varying scale
have received increased attention in recent decades (Kassens-Noor, Wilson, Müller, Maharaj, & Huntoon,
2015). According to Andranovich, Burbank, and Heying
(2001), this is due to greater competition between cities
with regard to their overall development and growth. To
many governments, especially politicians in major cities,
sporting events are a significant tool for urban development
because they are seen as a potential solution to the new
challenges of globalized capitalism. Put differently, sporting events now play ‘an integral role in how cities see themselves, and [are] becoming one of the anchors of
consumption-based development’ (Black, 2008, p. 116).
However, and as mentioned in the introduction, hosting events such as the Olympics, the World Cup and European Football Championship usually demand the use of
taxpayers’ money to yield the benefits they promise
(Baade & Matheson, 2000). Public funds are therefore
often used to construct facilities and other infrastructure,
or simply to acquire the hosting rights to these events
(Mourâo, 2017). As this public spending is often substantial (Flyvbjerg & Stewart, 2016), and public budgets are
scarce by definition, scrutinizing the ambition of sport
event legacies has become imperative to the point of
being a public concern (Crompton, 1995).
Several methodological approaches have been used to
estimate the economic benefits of sporting events, including F1, the most common being IO modelling (Jasmand
& Maennig, 2008). For example, Kim et al. (2017) estimated that the Chinese F1 Grand Prix in Shanghai had
an economic impact of no less than ‘205.85 million yuan
(approx. US$30.6 million) of output, 75.51 million yuan
(approx. US$11.2 million) of income and 17.80 million
yuan (approx. US$ 2.6 million) of indirect tax’ (p. 70),
and created 1409 full-time-equivalent jobs. Although
foreign spectators made up less than 6% of the total number
of spectators, they accounted for more than one-quarter of
the total expenditures, leading to the conclusion that host
cities should focus on increasing the number of international attendees to maximize economic impact.
Huang, Mao, Kim, and Zhang (2014), also applying IO
modelling, similarly reported sufficient spending among
non-locals at the Shanghai Grand Prix in 2012. However,
they estimated a much higher economic impact of 1179
million yuan (US$174.28 million) in output, 453 million
yuan (US$66.96 million) in income and 120 million yuan
(US$17.74 million) of indirect tax and created 9048 fulltime-equivalent jobs. Moreover, a report from Ernst &
Young (2011), commissioned by the Victorian government
estimated, using a CGE model, that the Australian F1
Grand Prix in Melbourne in 2011 increased the Victorian
gross state product by US$32–39 million, creating between
351 and 411 full-time-equivalent jobs. This led Tourism
Victoria (2011) to claim that: ‘Hosting the Formula One
Australian Grand Prix brings significant benefits to Victoria.’ Remenyik and Molnár (2017) use descriptive statistics on hotel nights and visitors attending the Hungarian
Grand Prix to argue that it is imperative to the Hungarian
tourist industry to keep the event on the F1 race calendar.
While these studies suggest that F1 generates significant economic benefits for the host cities and/or regions,
they all have something in common: they leave out the
cost of the event (Taks et al., 2011). According to Késenne
(2005) and Andreff (2017), economic impact studies are, in
many cases, simply used to justify the realization of large
sporting events and do not base their findings on valid
methodologies. These studies often use exaggerated multipliers that inflate the impact (Matheson, 2009; Siegfried &
Zimbalist, 2000), and although impact studies are different, and some are more sophisticated than others, they
typically do not take crowding-out effects or ‘switching’
into consideration (Burns, Hatch, & Mules, 1986). Furthermore, leakages or imports from other nations to produce the event are not often dealt with (Matheson, 2008,
2009). Finally, opportunity costs (Black, 2008) and relevant environmental issues (Cairns, 2009) are rarely considered. Hence, Késenne (2005) concludes that ‘even a
properly conducted economic impact study does not provide a sensible argument for the government to support a
project [alone]’ (p. 134).
Cost–benefit analysis (CBA), on the other hand, estimates the net welfare effect of an event by taking all
benefits and costs into consideration, and is therefore better
designed to answer public policy questions (Barget & Gouguet, 2010). Abelson (2011) argues that stakeholders advocating to host a sporting event should not rely on CGE or
IO models, but only claim that the event provides economic benefits to the community if it passes a CBA.
Demonstrating how one can apply a proper CBA – thus
addressing these problems – Késenne (2005) shows how
a sporting event can produce a negative net benefit taking
these issues into consideration, even though the traditional
economic impact study would have yielded a (significantly)
positive result.
Pearson (2007) applies a CBA to the Australian F1
Grand Prix in Melbourne in 2005, estimating the net
benefits to be negative (A$6.7 million). Also applying
CBA to the 2011 and 2012 Australian F1 Grands Prix in
Melbourne, Campbell (2013) (mid)estimates net losses of
A$52.7 million and A$60.5 million, respectively. Even
though the estimates hold some uncertainty, his report concludes that: ‘Given the magnitude of these loss estimates and
the reliability of the major costs and benefits, our strong conclusion is that the race reduces the economic welfare of Victoria and that it should be discontinued’ (p. 5).
Additionally, Campbell (2011) criticizes Tourism Victoria for its interpretation of the report from Ernst &
Young (2011) on the 2011 Australian F1 Grand Prix in
Melbourne. As a CGE cannot measure the net benefits on
the community, he argues that ‘Tourism Victoria have misconducted the Auditor General’s appeal for cost–benefit
analysis and transparent modelling’ (p. 10). Similarly to
Abelson (2011), he further argues that gross state product
and expenditure are poor measures of economic welfare.
Mules (1998) argues that taxpayer-financed subsidies to
host events such as the F1 Grand Prix in Australia are not
justified by the effects of the event. As these are marginal,
‘it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the taxpayer is
generally the loser in the hosting of major sporting events’
(p. 42). To politicians and the public, it can, however, be
difficult to understand that sporting events can have a
negative net effect on welfare due to the inflow of money
into the community, but this is first and foremost due to
the costs being overlooked (Fairley, Tyler, Kellett, &
D’Elia, 2011). Furthermore, ‘“Booster coalitions” invoke
a familiar litany of presumed benefits, with relatively
minor variations, to support their arguments that sport
mega-events will bring major gains to the “whole community”’ (Black, 2008, p. 470).
Siegfried and Zimbalist (2000) also point to flaws in the
typical impact-analysis approach. They argue that comparing places that host sporting events (in their case, major league matches) with places that do not is a much more
appropriate way to measure potential economic development caused by – in their case – team sports franchises.
It does not take the question of costs into direct consideration, but allows one to control for other factors affecting
the impact and see whether there are any lagged effects.
Coates and Gearhart (2008) and Baade and Matheson
(2000) deploy (such) appropriate modelling specifically in
relation to the Daytona 500 circuit in Volusia County
and NASCAR tracks and events (both in the United
States), finding that cities aiming to host a race or a circuit
should not expect the impact usually claimed by advocates.
In this paper, we follow the logic of these scholars
whilst extending the scope of earlier studies on F1 from
focusing on one specific race, host city or region to more
areas with F1 races. There are three reasons for this
approach. First, conducting a proper CBA (as recommended by the contemporary literature) is costly and
would require sourcing data that are not easily accessible.
Second, owing to the high of costs of a CBA, it would
limit the analysis to only very few F1 races, which makes
it difficult to generalize the findings. Third, while IO,
CGE and CBAs have already been done on F1 races, no
analyses deploying regression modelling (on objective data)
exist. Expanding on existing research, we assess whether we
can identify the economic benefits connected to F1 races on
a more general level. The following section presents our
approach in more detail.
In taking an appropriate modelling approach, we apply
dynamic panel data to the period 1991–2017. The advantage of this approach is that we can use objective data that
are not affected by inflated multipliers or similar problems
associated with strong assumptions built into the modelling
techniques of the approaches described above. While we
recognize that using a panel-data regression technique is
not without its problems, we believe that the benefits of
the approach add to the existing literature by yielding
results that can be compared with those produced by
studies applying different methodologies. Overall, we will
gain a better understanding of the scope of the potential
benefits (or costs) that can be expected from hosting F1
races.
We investigate 10 European regions with variations
in our independent variable F1race. This means that
these regions are those that have both hosted and not
hosted an F1 race during the period of investigation.
Many cities host F1 races annually, the most famous
being Monaco. However, because Monaco hosts a race
every year, it is impossible to determine whether any differences observed between Monaco and cities without an F1
race are due to the Grand Prix or other differences between
the cities. Thus, some relevant regions are – for methodological reasons – left out of the analysis and only (all) years
with and without hosting an F1 race in the (10) relevant
regions are included in the deployed data. In this sense,
we compare the years of hosting an F1 race with the
years without (in the same regions) to identify an F1
race’s potential effect on our dependent variables (see
below). Given the available data, we argue that this is the
best possible approach in comparable terms between treated (F1 race regions) and untreated (without F1 races)
data groups. Table A1 in Appendix A in the supplemental
data online lists the years in which the 10 regions have
hosted a race.
We run models with gross domestic product (GDP;
measured in €) to test the effect of hosting an F1 race on
the overall economy, and nights spent on tourist accommodation to test F1’s effect on tourism. We also run models
with employment and GDP per capita. The data were collected from Eurostat (2018) with nights spent log transformed in order to reduce skewness and kurtosis.
The reason for running both GDP and GDPpc models
is because arguments in favour of hosting F1 are rarely presented to affect GDP per capita, but reported to produce
the impact in absolute figures (e.g., producing an effect
of, say, US$500 million in additional tourist spending).
Thus, using absolute figures tests the question of economic
effects in intuitively straightforward values and is also a
more sensitive approach than GDPpc. However, as
GDPpc is a common variable for use in econometric testing; we also include this (dependent) variable in one set of
models.
Regarding the employment variable, impacts are often
argued to increase the amount of jobs in the area in question why testing this assumption is also relevant. All data
– both dependent and independent – are annual.
We focus on Europe because objective data relevant for
analysis are not available for other world regions. From this
perspective, we anticipate that nation aggregate data on
GDP or tourist visits are too ‘insensitive’ to measure
impacts, and hence use lower level regional data from
Eurostat.
The Eurostat database contains comparable regional
statistics for European Union member nations. The data
used for this study cover 3.06 million people per region
on average, with a standard deviation (SD) of 2.3 million,
which is not a perfect level of sensitivity but reasonable
enough for potential effects to be measured. At least
this is the closest we can come in terms of data power if
we want to apply objective data – as stated above – because
lower level data (which would potentially be more sensitive)
are not available.
Another weakness is that while Eurostat’s database covers a great deal of topics measured over several years, there
is little publicly available information that is relevant for
constructing explanatory (independent) variables in our
regression models. Accordingly, our models are relatively
simple. From a theoretical perspective, only the available
Eurostat data on crime (GDP and tourism), employment
(GDP), and education (GDP) are suitable to include as
controls. We ran models with these variables (not
reported), producing results that are consistent with the
overall results. The crime variable was not included as
only three years of data were available.
We present a broad set of models: eight with GDPpc, four
with nights spent as the dependent, eight with GDP and
eight with employment as the dependent. Eight of the
models test the effect of F1race in the same year, and
another eight of the models test the effect of F1race in
the year before measuring the dependent variable. The
argument for the latter option is that it could take time
for the effect of an F1 event to manifest itself in the dependent variable.
We investigate dynamic panel data where there is a time
trend present. First, we present fixed effects (FE) models to
account for unit-level unobserved heterogeneity and
include a lagged dependent variable. This is done by
including the unit-specific dummy variable D , which
takes into account the time-invariant independent variables
that cannot be included in our model, as well as unmeasured time-invariant variables (Mehmetoglu & Jakobsen,
2017). The rationale behind employing region FE is that
the regions are not necessarily comparable because of factors that we cannot include in the models (there are very
little data and a limited N ). In an ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression, we would not be certain of what type
of effect we were measuring. The above-mentioned differences between regions are, in our FE models, captured by
their unique intercepts, and we can overcome much of
the problem of spurious relationships, leaving a purer
relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Our models testing effects in the same year and in the
year before measuring the dependent variable are expressed
in equations (1) and (2), respectively:
However, as the FE estimates are known to suffer from
Nickell bias (Nickell, 1981), we also present models
using the Arellano–Bond estimator (AB) (Arellano &
Bond, 1991). These models are specified as a system of
equations, one for each time period, including different
instruments (constructed based on lagged values of the
dependent) for each equation. The AB dynamic panel
data estimator uses moment conditions to remove bias
introduced by the correlation between the unobserved
panel effects and the lagged dependent variable. We
make use of the xtabond2 command in Stata (Roodman,
2009), where the first-difference transformation removes
both the constant term and the individual effect, as
expressed in equations (3) and (4):
We also ran additional sensitivity models (not presented),
including OLS regression, random effects, first differences
and the original AB models, all yielding similar results from
that of the main analysis.
As we are investigating the whole population of European regions that have both hosted and not hosted F1 races
during the relevant period, we are generalizing within stochastic model theory rather than within sample theory.
That is, we are generalizing from the observations made
to the process or mechanism that brings about the actual
data (Gold, 1969; Henkel, 1976; Mehmetoglu & Jakobsen,
2017).
Table 1 presents data ranging from 1991 to 2016 showing nights spent on accommodation in the host city, and
from 2000 to 2015 for GDPpc and GDP. Employment
data range from 1999 to 2017. For the independent
variable F1race, there are a total of 119 observations o
hosting a race and 141 observations of not hosting one.
We also ran the models using different lags and leads.
The argument for leading the independent variable is
that we allow for some of the benefits to accrue in the
years before hosting an F1 race, while the argument for
testing further lags is to assess whether there are any legacy
benefits from hosting (see also Jakobsen et al., 2013). Of
these models, we only present those where there is a significant effect (i.e., with three- and four-year lags; see below).
These models are expressed in equations (5) to (8):
Regarding the effect of F1race on nights spent, we find no
significant effect and the signs change from positive to
negative from the FE to the AB models. For the models
with GDPpc as the dependent, the effect is negative for
both hosting a race in the same year and hosting in the previous year, though neither result is statistically significant
(Tables 2 and 3).
Our models with GDP and employment in Tables 4
and 5 show negative effects. However, they are not significant for employment. The AB estimations produce the same
results.
For our lagged models (equations 5–8), we find significant results when lagging our independent variables three
and four years for the models investigating GDPpc,
GDP and employment (only the AB estimation). Here,
the results are negative at either the 5% or 10% levels.
This can read in Tables 6–8. The results imply that there
actually are some negative legacy results from hosting an
F1 race for the regions in question.
Overall, the analysis challenges the positive side of the
debate about the economic benefits of hosting an F1
race, at least at the regional level in Europe. On the contrary, there could actually be a delayed negative effect
when it comes to regional GDPpc and absolute GDP.
We also find lagged negative effects in relation to
employment.

The conclusion will discuss the implications of the findings together with the limitations of the study and future
research perspectives.
In this paper we have employed robust panel data
regression techniques on objective data to conduct a
study examining the tangible economic effects of F1
races. We limited the analyses to European regions
owing to the lack of comparable data on all F1 race hosts.
The regression output of our models suggests that, at
the (power) level of analysis offered by the data, it is not
possible to support the claim that hosting an F1 race
event yields positive effects on (per capita) GDP, employment or tourism in the regions covered. On the contrary, it
seems that negative legacies can materialize three to four
years after the event. These results are consistent with existing research that finds economic effects from major sporting events are usually absent and sometimes even negative.
With regard to our lagged models, it is difficult to ascertain why the effect is negative – and why it is a lagged one.
As pointed out by Värja (2016), one explanation might be
that the negative effects are caused by the inefficient use of
public money. As mentioned above, the hosting of an F1
race usually requires host nations or cities to pay large subsidies to cover hosting fees, and prepare the race circuit and
related infrastructure. The negative effect suggests that
there are substantial opportunity costs associated with
being an F1 host. This is consistent with the evidence provided by proponents of the CBA approach (e.g., Késenne,
2005; Taks et al., 2011).
Another possibility is that (private) tourist spending
associated with the races is offset by the lack of spending
by tourists who are negatively affected by the brand of
F1, for example, in relation to environmental issues, and
thus choose not to visit the host city or nations (anymore).
Some local residents could also be affected by the hosting
role to such an extent that, after some years of experiencing
the races, they choose to leave the region during the event,
thus reducing spending in the area and resulting in a negative impact (Preuss, 2005).
With regard to the negative effect being lagged, it is
likely that the ‘investment’ simply does not take effect
until some years after, as can be the case with other –
more long-term – investments. It is possible that spending
cuts in other areas of the public budget related to the prioritization of F1 are gradually implemented, or that other
structural arrangements in the public sector simply slow
down the pace of the (negative) impact. Provided we only
have limited data at hand for analysis, we cannot answer
this question in more detail. We will touch on this issue
further below after we have reflected on the implications
of the study.
The implications of our findings are that politicians, public
authorities and other stakeholders should reconsider the
argument that using public funds to host F1 races is a
sound investment. Even though claims about significant
benefits are commonly made, most economic scholars
agree that they almost never prove to be the reality when
examined closely – particularly for major sporting events
(Coates & Humphreys, 2008).
In connection to this, other effects, such as intangible
forms of utility gained among citizens in the host nations
and cities, can also be used to justify the hosting of F1
races (e.g., see Humphreys, Johnson, Mason, & Whitehead, 2018, on the value of medal success in the Olympic
Games; Johnson & Whitehead, 2000, on the value of
sport stadiums; and Wicker, Whitehead, Johnson, &
Mason, 2016, on German football). However, evidence
should be found to prove that such intangible effects exist
before using them as argumentation. Based on the available
evidence, we argue that hosting an F1 race does not produce net positive tangible effects, and hence does not justify
the use of large amounts of public funds on such events.
The approach deployed in this paper has some limitations
that point towards future research opportunities. First, the
available data used in our regression models are not very
detailed or sensitive. We have not been able to model
data from many regions and our models would have benefited from the inclusion of more explanatory (control) variables if the data were available. Data covering more regions
may have yielded a more nuanced result. Further, there is a
problem of the power of the data. If comparable data on a
lower stratum than the regions deployed existed, our
models could potentially produce more measurable effects
than explored in this study because the data would be
more sensitive.
Based on these limitations, the results should be seen
only as a first step towards developing more comprehensive
studies on the impact of F1 in the future. A recommendation would be to have national statistics bureaus in the
nations hosting F1 races outside European member nations
gather regional level data that make it possible to conduct
more in-depth studies. Moreover, we recommend that
data are collected on lower level strata, so that, for example,
econometric modelling – as presented here – would gain
more power from the data. While we realize that these suggestions are very specific recommendations, it is imperative
to advance the research on F1 – and similar events – until
stronger evidence is found. This would certainly benefit the
decision-making process and public debates on the demand
for public subsidies for events such as F1. Modelling data
entailing not only more (and smaller) regions but also
more explanatory variables is another relevant suggestion
for future research.

7. A variation of this problem is highlighted by Dwyer
et al. (2005), who argue that ‘When there is an increase
in spending in the economy from visitors from abroad,
the exchange rate will be bid up, discouraging exports
and economic activity in other parts of the economy’
(p. 353).
8. This includes Baden-Württemberg, Cadiz, EmiliaRomagna, Leicestershire, Liege, Lisbia, Nièvre, Rheinland-Pfalz, Steiermark and Valencia.
9. The span of the investigated period is chosen due to the
format of the available Eurostat data.
10. As can be seen in Table A1, there are some cases of
circuits with sporadic hosting, such as in Belgium and
the two locations in Germany. If this is somehow connected to GDP or tourism issues, it could potentially create
a problem for the analysis. We searched for information on
these issues, only finding sporadic information. Regarding
the German tracks, this on-and-off host status is due to a
biennial swap deal between Hockenheimring and Nürburgring. No information indicates that this deal is connected to issues related to GDP or tourism. The swap
deal, in fact, makes the analysis stronger because it is possible to compare years with and without races. With regard
to the Belgium race track, it appears that it was dropped in
2006 due to maintenance issue.
