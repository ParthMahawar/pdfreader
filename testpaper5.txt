Abstract
The analysis of individual game performance is a necessary part of the coach´s daily work. It can provide the
coach with accurate and detailed information and data on the league requirements for the individual game
performance of a player. This information is essential for the creation and optimization of the training process. In
this study, we examined the technical–tactical profile of elite goalkeepers in professional soccer. The research
group consisted of selected goalkeepers (n = 12) from four European soccer leagues (i.e., English, German,
Spanish and Italian). The goalkeepers were observed at all home competition matches during the 2019/2020
season (a total of 406 matches). We recorded and evaluated the chosen aspects of the goalkeepers´ game
performance, i.e., the number and success rate of defensive, offensive and all game activities. To acquire
research results, we used the method of indirect observation of chosen game activities developed by the InStat
technologies. We used one-way ANOVA tests, the post hoc Tuckey HSD test and the Z-score test for two
population proportions to process and evaluate the research data. The level of statistical significance was set at
the 5% level. We found significant differences in the number of goalkeepers´ game activities and in the success
rate of defensive and offensive game activities. We did not find any significant differences in the overall success
rate of game activities. This research confirms trends and developments in the goalkeepers´ game and indicates
increasing demands placed on the goalkeepers´ game. These demands are mainly regarding the success rate of
solving game situations.
Key words: soccer, goalkeeper, game performance, game activity, success rate, profile
Introduction
The player´s individual game performance is a unique phenomenon in a match, during which he
participates
in the game performance of the whole team and tries to help his playmates achieve their common goal.
The individual game performance has in the match two basic forms of expression. The technical activity
comprises all player´s game activities in a match, with which he has to deal using his abilities. It represents the
technical-tactical demands of the match on a player and is characterized by the complexity of the training load.
The player´s physical activity in a match is most often expressed by the load volume and intensity. It means that
the physical activity represents the complex of demands on the player´s organism, both physically and mentally.
It is not an easy task to assess which one of these two areas has a bigger or more significant impact on the final
game performance of a player in a match. Several authors (Lago-Penas et al. 2010, Castelano et al. 2012, Carling
2013, Hoppe et al. 2015, Nassis et al. 2015, Moalla et al. 2018) agreed that the technical activity in a match is for
the player more important than the physical activity. It is so especially due to the fact that the technical activity
and its impact on the match result can be easier quantified than the influence of physical activity on it. But we
agree with Kokstejn and Muselaek (2019), that specific game actions (technical activity) and non-specific game
actions (physical activity) are very deep connected to each other and have to be developed at the same time.
Compared to other game functions, the goalkeeper position is a unique one (Konefal et al. 2019, Obetko
et al. 2019, Obetko et al. 2020). It reflects itself significantly in his individual game performance. The physical
and technical activity of a goalkeeper and his role on the field is quite different from the roles of other players.
Many authors confirmed this fact in their works (Di Salvio et al. 2008, Seaton & Campos 2011, Liu et al. 2015,
Padulo et al. 2015, Konefal et al. 2019, Schwarz et al. 2019). Obetko et al. (2019) describe it as a critical player
function, which has a significant impact on the team´s match result too. The main and currently also the
traditional function of a goalkeeper in match is to stop the opponent from scoring a goal. However, in recent
years, the goalkeeper´s game has also changed and evolved as a result of a change in rules. Besides, the
requirements for the goalkeeper´s game have changed too. It is still the case that the core function of a
goalkeeper is to prevent the goal, but nowadays is his cooperation with teammates in the offensive game phase
also almost as important. It has increased the demands on the goalkeeper´s game from a technical point of view

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Szwarc et al. 2010, Seaton and Campos 2011, Liu et al. 2015 Szwarc et al. 2019). These findings have to be
reflected also in the content of the training process and his proportionality of the goalkeeper´s game activities
during a match. Several studies confirm this fact too (Liu et al. 2015, Soares et al. 2018, White et al. 2018). The
authors of these studies state that the current proportion of game activities within a one-year-long training cycle
is approximately 60-70%, in favour of offensive game activities.
Many different factors influence the final match result and the goalkeeper's individual game
performance in a match (Wilson et al. 2019). The goalkeeper´s game is characterized mainly by decision
making, his mentality, technical skills and physical fitness (Otte et al. 2019). In other words, the final individual
game performance in a match is only some form of integration of these factors. If a goalkeeper wants to
constantly improve his performance, he has to improve these factors in a training unit. In several studies proved
the authors the impact of various training stimuli on the development of certain/specific aspects of the individual
game performance (Chtara 2017, Karahan 2020). However, soccer as a sport is constantly developing, pushing
the envelope, and the demands on the technical, tactical, conditional but also the psychological, level of players
are still higher and higher (Andrzejewski 2012, Chmura 2018). Therefore, soccer and individual game
performance nowadays requires a complex process in the development of players. It is important also in order to
achieve the improvement of several factors of individual game performance at the same time. It can be achieved
in a training which is oriented on solving match situations, so-called game-situation based training.
Implementing this type of training also according to Esposito et al. (2019), we can influence the technical,
tactical, conditional, but also the psychological aspect of the player's individual game performance. Besides, this
way we can affect the activity factors of team game performance too. To apply this type of training into the
training plan, we have to know the personality of the concrete goalkeeper, but also the requirements of a league
on his game performance. For this purpose, we use the diagnostics of individual game performance.
Analysis of individual game performance is nowadays seen as a necessary tool for the coach while
doing his job. Relevant data gained using modern software shows us the demands which are put on the player in
a match, but also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of his playmates and opponents. It also helps by the
planning and the possible adjustments of the training process in order to increase the performance level of
players (Bradley et al. 2013, Clemente et al. 2013, Arruda et al. 2015, Sannicandro et al. 2016, Filetti et al. 2017,
Pascual-Verdú & Carbonell-Martínnez 2018, Konefal et al. 2019, Szwarc et al. 2019, Zhou et al. 2020). The
coach always tries to increase the performance level of his players. The indicator of a trend in a certain area
should always be the best players in the given player positions, ideally in the best long-term leagues in Europe,
or in the world and the above mentioned leagues certainly belong to these. Professional soccer teams in Europe
are at the same level and there are minimal differences between the best teams. Therefore, we assume that
between the observed goalkeepers there will be no significant differences regarding the monitored indicators of
individual game performance.
Material & methods
Characteristics of the research group
The research group was comprised of selected goalkeepers (n = 12) from the 4 top European leagues English Premier League, Spanish Primera División, German Bundesliga and Italien Serie A. From each league,
we selected goalkeepers (n = 3) who were monitored in all matches of the 2019/2020 season in which they
played. We chose goalkeepers who achieved in the season, according to the Instat software, the best ranking –
Instat index in their league. Goalkeepers included in this research group had to play in a minimum of 20 matches
in the season.
The average age of monitored goalkeepers was 28.5 3.94 years. The average height of the monitored
goalkeepers was 191.42 3.99 cm and the average weight was 89.1 3.4 kg.
Data acquisition and processing
To acquire the research data, we used the indirect monitoring of match video recordings by the Instat technology.
In our research, we focused on the following aspects of the goalkeeper´s individual game performance:
 Total number and success rate of goalkeeper´s game activities
 Number and success rate of defensive and offensive game activities of goalkeeper
The goalkeeper´s game activities were divided according to the adjusted/changed methods (Babic & Holienka
2019) and the InStat software into the following categories:
 Offensive game activities
 Defensive game activities
Individual game activities were evaluated according to the video recording (electronic data carrier) using signs
+/- into prepared record sheets based on the adjusted methods (Babic & Holiennka). The number of matches was
not the same because we monitored the goalkeepers in all the soccer matches, they played in the season
2019/2020.
The English Premier League goalkeepers were observed in 102 matches, the Spanish Primera División
goalkeepers in 108 matches, the goalkeepers of Italian Serie A in 100 matches and the German Bundesliga
goalkeepers in 96 matches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Statistical evaluation of data
By the monitored goalkeepers, we evaluated the differences in the following game performance
indicators: the number of all game activities, the success rate of all game activities, the number of defensive
game activities, the success rate of defensive game activities, the number of offensive game activities and the
success rate of offensive game activities. To verify the hypothesis, in which we did not assume any significant
differences in selected game performance indicators, we used the one-way ANOVA test (to evaluate the
differences in the number of game activities) and the post hoc Tukey HSD test. Using the Z-score test for two
population proportions, we evaluated the differences in the success rate of game activities. The level of statistical
significance was set at p < 0.05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Discussion
This research aimed to found out which requirements put the best club leagues in professional soccer
on the goalkeeper´s individual game performance and what is the technical-tactical profile of goalkeeper´s game
performance in a match. Based on our results, we found that the technical-tactical profile of the goalkeeper´s
individual game performance has been during recent years moving towards the dominance and superiority
of goalkeeper´s offensive game activities over the defensive ones (De Baranda 2008, Liu et al. 2015,
Berto & Magalhaes 2017, Serrano et al. 2018, West 2018). This trend of recent years was shown also in our
research. Peráček et al. (2008a, 2008b) analysed the goalkeeper´s game performance in significant international
matches and 2005/2006 seasons of the Champions League and found that the ratio of goalkeeper´s offensive
game activities to the defensive game activities is approximately 50:50 %. On the contrary, in our research
dominated in goalkeeper´s game performance the offensive game activities to the defensive ones in a ratio of
approximately 75-80%.
When comparing this trend with the near past time, it is quite similar. However, compared to the past,
the difference is in the number of game activities (Serrano et al. 2018, West 2018). There is a moderate increase
in the number of game activities, which the goalkeepers perform during a match. In all matches that we
monitored in our research (406), we recorded by goalkeepers the total number of 13841 game activities, which
on average represents 34 game activities per match. Moreover, we recorded significant differences in the number
of goalkeepers´ game activities among the individual leagues. But these data and facts do not show us the
relevant differences in the number of game activities of a goalkeeper. The differences in the number could be
especially seen when we would monitor the goalkeepers´ defensive and offensive game activities in a match
separately. The number of offensive game activities by goalkeepers is over the years decreasing. While during
the European Championships in 2012 was by the tournament finalists recorded an average of 16.33 shots per
match (Shafizadeh et al. 2013), in the Bundesliga (2014-2017) recorded Konefal et al. (2019) an average of 7.58
shots per game, which is 54% less than the average of the 2012 European Championship finalist. Serrano et al.
(Serrano et al. 2018) also recorded in their analysis of six consecutive years (between 2011 and 2017) of the
Spanish La Liga a decrease in the number of goalie interventions.
In the last monitored 2016/2017 season, there were even only three defensive game activities on
average per match. One of the reasons for this case is that teams get to a smaller number of finishing. According
to De Baranda et al. (2008), only about 4% of all offensive game phases are finished by shooting into the goal.
Therefore, the number of goalkeepers´ interventions is lower than in the past. On the other hand, the number of
offensive game activities by the goalkeeper increases. Especially when speaking about short and medium
distance passes. This trend was confirmed by several authors, who analysed the number of passes in the German
Bundesliga (Konefal et al. 2019), Spanish La Liga (Serrano et al. 2018) or English Premier League (Bush et al.
2015). They found that the number of passes in individual player functions, including goalkeepers, is constantly
increasing. In the English Premier League, the number of passes in some player positions increased by 50 to
70% (Bush et al. 2015). They found that the number of passes in individual player functions, including
goalkeepers, is permanently increasing. The number of ball passes in the English Premier League increased in
some player positions from 50 to 70% (Bush et al. 2015). According to West (2018), this is because of the
philosophy change, or rather the change in the team game style, which means that the goalkeepers are required to
be more involved in the offensive phase of the game. We agree with this fact. It is confirmed also by the
conclusion of the study by Liu et al. (2015). They found by the monitoring of the Spanish La Liga goalkeepers in
the 2012/2013 season that the number of offensive game activities was an average of 20 activities per match. In
our research, we found an overall average of 30 offensive activities per game, which was the same results as by
the Spanish La Liga. This is proof that significant differences have emerged over the years and that there are
differences not only over the years, but according to Wang and Qin (2020) there are significant differences in
technical activity between different leagues.
As the number of goalkeeper´s game activities is getting smaller, almost every game situation in a
match can be for the team critical. That´s why the requirements for the quality, or the success rate during the
performance of defensive game activities, considerably increase. Therefore, the main role of the goalkeeper in
the match comes to the fore. Despite certain trends, it has still not changed over the years. His role is primarily to
stop the opponent from scoring a goal. Although the main goalkeeper´s task is to prevent the opposing team from
scoring a goal, we cannot ignore the trends and tendencies in this sphere. We found that in recent years there has
been not only a strong increase in the number of offensive game activities, but especially an important increase
in the quality of their implementation. This can be seen when comparing the Spanish La Liga goalkeepers´
success rate of offensive game activities in the 2012/2013 season, in which they achieved a success rate of
58.9% (Liu et al. 2013). In their further research, Serrano et al. (2018) found that in the Spanish La Liga
increased (between 2011 and 2017) goalkeepers´ success rate from 63% to 77%.
In our research, we recorded the success rate of offensive game activities of the Spanish La Liga
goalkeepers at the level of 88.97% and the overall success rate of goalkeepers´ offensive game activities in all
monitored leagues was at the level of 90.87%. This is a significant improvement that West (2018) attributes to
the change in the demands on the goalkeeper's game due to the change in the philosophy and game performance
of the team, to which all player functions had to be adapted, not just the goalkeeper's function. These new
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4

MARCO OBETKO, PAVOL PERÁČEK, MARTIN MIKULIČ, MATEJ BABIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------emands were reflected in the work of Barnes et al. (2014), who found that the number of players in the English
Premier League, who have a pass success rate below 70%, fell between 2006 and 2013 from 26% to 9%.
However, if we compare the goalkeeper´s individual game performance from a complex point of view,
we will find that between the individual leagues that we observed in our research, we did not find any significant
differences in the overall success of the goalkeepers´ game activities. The table of top European and world
players in this player function is very wide and there are only minor differences between them, which are based
on a comprehensive analysis not evident.
Conclusion
Only accurate data on sports science can provide us with answers to the questions regarding the
demands of the game on the team game performance and the individual performance of players. Nowadays, the
list of the world's top players in Europe is very wide and the differences between the individual leagues are
minimal. Therefore, a comprehensive and detailed analysis is needed to reveal the individual specifics,
differences and demands on individual game performance. It serves not only for coaches to find out the
requirements but also as a tool for creating and optimizing the training process.
Using a comprehensive analysis of the individual game performance of goalkeepers, we did not find
any significant differences in the most important aspect of the goalkeeper's game, thus the success rate of
performing game activities. To identify the differences and subtle specifics, we deepened the analysis and
performed a more detailed analysis of the goalkeeper's performance based on selected aspects of game
performance. During the elaboration of this in-depth analysis, we managed to find significant differences in the
success rate of game activities (defensive - offensive) but especially in the number of game activities, as we
found significant differences between individual leagues.
Based on the acquired results, we can say that even though there are only small differences between the
goalkeepers of different leagues on a professional level, from a complex and global point of view are the
differences minimal, and above all, the demands on the goalkeeper's game are constantly increasing, especially
in terms of the success rate of game activities.
